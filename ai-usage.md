I used a small bit of ai during this. I used chatGPT for help with setting up python-tests.yml. 
I've never messed with any git functionality such as that and it got a bit confusing with where to put certain files for it.
I verified it by rereading the github docs the instructor posted.
It's also been a while since I coded so I used ai a bit to reremember certain syntax for things such as dictionaries and lists in python using my own prior knowledge. I verified this by using it as sort of a refresher. Once I saw it it sparked sort of an "oh yeah that's how" in my head. 
That was all I used ai for and coded everything else.
