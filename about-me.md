* I have coded in Python, Java, a little bit of C and C++, and some dart in 222.

* I haven't had any internships or programming jobs yet so my programming experience is limited to mainly class projects and some personal projects I've worked on.
  For example in CS 222 some projects I worked on in there is a website that parses a Wikipedia article and showcases different information from it and a guitar chord app.
  This app was one where you can input a chord you want to view and the app will showcase both a Chord Chart showcasing it and a Youtube tutorial video. I've also worked on
  Database projects using MySql.

* The largest program I worked on was the Guitar chord app I explained above. This was done with 3 other members and was our final project in CS 222 programmed in dart.
 
* I'd say I'm most comfortable writing python scripts, and solving small problems through code.
 
* I'm least comfortable with front-end development. I haven't coded in languages such as CSS and JavaScript that are frequently seen in front end development. I also get quite
  confused sometimes when it comes to implementation from back end to front end.

* My major is Computer Science with a concentration in CyberSecurity. I am also hoppening to minor in IT.
